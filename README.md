## Facebook Business page

Creating a Facebook Business Page can be an important step in your business's social media marketing strategy. It allows your business to have a public presence on Facebook, providing a space for you to share updates, post about products or services, engage with customers, and reach new audiences.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a Facebook Business Page:

1. Log in to Facebook:

If you don't already have a personal Facebook account, you'll need to create one first. Facebook requires every business page to be linked to a personal account for admin purposes.

2. Create a Page:

Once you're logged in, go to the "Pages" section in the main menu (on the left side of your home page). Click on "Create New Page".

3. Choose a Page Type:

You'll be asked to choose a category for your page. The most common choice is "Business or Brand". Click on "Get Started" under your chosen category.

4. Fill Out Information:

Now, you'll need to provide some information about your business, including:

- Page Name: This will be the name of your Business Page on Facebook. It should match or closely align with the name of your business.
Category: Type a word or two that describes your business, and Facebook will suggest some options. Choose the one that fits your business best.
- Description: Write a short description of your business (up to 255 characters). This should be a brief outline of what your business does.
- Website (optional): If you have a business website, you can include it here.

5. Add a Profile Picture and Cover Photo:

Add a profile picture for your Business Page. This is often your company logo. Then, add a cover photo. This is a larger, banner-style photo that appears at the top of your page. It should relate to your business in some way and be engaging.

6. Add More Details:

After creating your page, fill in additional details in the "About" section, such as:

- Contact information: Include phone numbers, email addresses, your website, etc.
- Location: If you have a physical store or office, put your address here.
- Hours: If applicable, fill in the hours of operation.
- Price range: This can give potential customers an idea of your pricing structure.

Create Your First Post:

Now your page is set up, it's a good time to create your first post. This can be a simple welcome message, an introduction of your business, or anything else that you feel would be appropriate for your new Facebook audience.

8. Invite People to Like Your Page:

Facebook will prompt you to invite people to like your new Business Page. Start with your personal Facebook friends who are likely to be interested in your business, and then expand from there.

Remember, Facebook is often the first place a customer goes to get information about a business, so having all your information up to date and easy to find is very important. Once your page is set up, you can start posting updates, sharing content, and interacting with your customers!

### Responsive design

Key features of responsive design include:

- **Fluid Grid Layout:** A flexible layout system that uses relative units (e.g., percentages) instead of fixed units (e.g., pixels) to define the width and height of elements, ensuring that the layout adjusts according to the screen size.

- **Flexible Images and Media:** Images, videos, and other media elements are set to automatically scale and resize according to the screen's dimensions, preventing distortion or overflow.

- **CSS Media Queries:** Media queries allow developers to apply different CSS styles based on the device's characteristics, such as screen size, resolution, and orientation. This enables the creation of device-specific designs that adapt to different viewing conditions.

- **Mobile-first Approach:** A design strategy that prioritizes the development of mobile layouts before scaling up to larger screens, ensuring that the user experience is optimized for mobile devices.

- **Touch-friendly Navigation:** User interface elements, such as buttons and menus, are designed to be easily accessible and navigable on touch-screen devices.

- **Optimized Performance:** Responsive designs often include techniques for improving website performance, such as image optimization, minification of CSS and JavaScript files, and lazy loading of assets, ensuring faster load times on mobile devices.

- **Seamless Content Display:** Content is organized and displayed in a way that maintains readability and usability across different devices, often using techniques such as collapsible menus, accordions, and content prioritization.

- **Cross-browser Compatibility:** Responsive designs are tested and optimized for compatibility across various web browsers, ensuring a consistent user experience.

- **Accessibility:** A responsive design should also consider accessibility guidelines and best practices, such as proper use of HTML tags, color contrast, and keyboard navigation, ensuring that the website is usable for people with disabilities.

Responsive design has become an essential aspect of modern web development, as it ensures that websites and applications are easily accessible and provide a consistent user experience across a wide range of devices.

## Database Schema

A database schema is a blueprint or structure that defines how data is organized in a database. It includes tables, fields, data types, relationships, and constraints that determine how the data is stored, related, and manipulated. Below is a basic example of a database schema for an e-commerce website like the one:

## Deployment

<br>

This project was deployed using

- Github - To store code and deploy the site.
- ElephantSql.com - To create an external database.
- Django and Heroku - To host the deployed project.
- Amazon AWS - To host the static and media files.

### GitHub

To create a new repository, I took the following steps:

1. Logged into GitHub.
2. Click the ‚Äòrepositories‚Äô section.
3. Click the green ‚Äònew‚Äô button to create new repository.
4. Choose ‚Äòrepository template‚Äô Used the code institute template as recommended from the dropdown menu.
5. Add repository name then clicked the green ‚Äòcreate repository button‚Äô at the bottom of the page.
6. Open the new repository and clicked the green ‚ÄòGitpod‚Äô button to create a workspace in Gitpod for editing.

### ElephantSql

Setting up ElephantSQL:

1. Access your ElephantSQL dashboard by logging in to ElephantSQL.com.
2. Click on "Create New Instance".
3. Set up your plan by giving it a name (usually the name of your project), selecting the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan, and leaving the Tags field blank.
4. Click on "Select Region" and then click on "Review".
5. Check your details and then click on "Create instance".
6. Go back to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the name of the database instance for your project.
7. To copy the database URL to your clipboard, click on the copy icon in the URL section.

### Django and Heroku

To set up the Django framework and configure the Heroku deployment, I followed these step-by-step instructions:

1. Installed Django framework and revisited the Walkthrough provided by Code institutes for assistance.
2. Logged into Heroku, went to the Dashboard and clicked on New to create a new app.
3. Gave the app a name, selected the region closest to me, and clicked Create app to confirm.
4. Opened the Settings tab and added the config var DATABASE_URL, and for the value, copied in the database URL from ElephantSQL.
5. Installed dj_database_url and psycopg2 in the terminal, both of which are required to connect to an external database.
6. Updated the requirements.txt file with the newly installed packages using pip freeze > requirements.txt.
7. Imported dj_database_url in the settings.py file and updated the DATABASES section with the new connection to the ElephantSQL database.
8. Ran the showmigrations command in the terminal to confirm the connection to the external database.
9. Migrated the database models to the new database using python3 manage.py migrate command.
10. Loaded in the fixtures in the correct order: categories first and then products.
11. Created a superuser for the new database using python3 manage.py createsuperuser command.
12. Deleted the database from the settings.py file to prevent exposing it when pushing to GitHub and reconnected to the local sqlite database.
13. Deployed the final version with DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ.

Note: For safety and security reasons, I generated a new Django secret key using a Django key generator and added it to both the env.py file and Heroku config vars. This ensured that even if the secret key had been pushed accidentally to GitHub, it would now be an invalid key.

### Amazon AWS

- #### Setting up Amazon AWS

To set up Amazon AWS, the following steps were taken (following the Code Institute walkthroughs to assist in setting up Amazon AWS):

1.  Log into Amazon AWS and signed in to the upper right by accessing the AWS management console under my account.
2.  Navigate to the Storage menu under All Services and clicked the link that says S3.
3.  Click the orange button that says 'Create Bucket'.
4.  Name the bucket and selected the closest region to me.
5.  Follow the [steps](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/AWS%20changes%20sheet.pdf) supplied by the Code Institute for Object Ownership.

- #### Connecting Django to S3

To connect Django to S3, the following steps were taken:

1.  Install the `Boto3` and `Django storages` packages by running the following commands:

    `pip3 install boto3`

    `pip3 install django-storages`

2.  Run the following command to save the installed packages to the `requirements.txt` file:

    `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

3.  Add 'storages' to the installed apps section inside the `settings.py` file.

4.  Add some additional settings to the same file to let Django know what bucket it's communicating with:
    - Near the bottom of the file, write an `if` statement to check if there is an environment variable called `USE_AWS` and add the following code inside:

```
if USE_AWS in os.environ:
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-your-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
```

5.  Add the following config vars in Heroku:
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    - USE_AWS set to True
6.  Remove the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` variable in Heroku.
7.  Go to the `settings.py` file in my Django project and add the following line inside the `if` statement written earlier:

    `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'`

8.  Create a custom_storages.py file and import my settings as well as the s3boto3 storage.
9.  Add the following two classes inside the `custom_storages.py` file:

```
class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
	location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
	location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

10. In the `settings.py` file, underneath the bucket config settings but still inside the `if` statement, add the following lines:

```
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
```

11. Override and explicitly set the URLs for static and media files using my custom domain and new locations. Add the following two lines inside the same if statement:

```
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```

12. After pushing the changes, the S3 bucket has a static folder with all the static files inside.

- #### Caching, Media Files & Stripe

To set up caching, media files, and Stripe, the following steps were taken:

1.  Open your `settings.py` file and add an `if` statement to handle media files caching. This allows static files to be cached for a long time and speeds up the loading of your site. Here's the code to add:

```
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
}
```

2.  Save your changes to `settings.py`, then add, commit, and push your changes to Git.
3.  Log in to your Amazon AWS account and navigate to your S3 bucket. Create a new folder called "media" and save it.
4.  Inside the new "media" folder, click "Upload," "Add files," and select all of the images you're using on your site. Note that your media folder must match the media folder within your Workspace gitpod.io.
5.  Under "Permissions," select "Grant public-read access" and click Upload. You may also need to check an acknowledgement warning checkbox.
6.  With those steps completed, all of your static and media files should automatically link from Django to your S3 bucket.
7.  In the Django admin, confirm the email address for the superuser in the Postgres database. This is necessary for the user to log in to the store.
8.  Add your Stripe keys to the Heroku Config Vars.
9.  Sign in to your Stripe account and navigate to the "Developers" tab at the top right of the navbar.
10. Under "Developers," click "Webhooks," then "Add endpoint" in the side-nav.

11. On the next page, enter the link to your Heroku app followed by `/checkout/wh/`. It should look something like this:

`https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`

12. Click "+ Select events" and check the "Select all events" checkbox at the top. Then click "Add events" at the bottom to complete the form.

13. Your webhook is now created, and it should have generated a secret key. You'll need this to add to your Heroku config vars.

14. Navigate to your app in Heroku and go to the "Config Vars" section under settings. You'll need the secret key you generated for your webhook, as well as your publishable key and secret key that you can find in the API keys section in Stripe.

15. Add these values under these keys:

```
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'insert your stripe publishable key'
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'insert your secret key'
STRIPE_WH_SECRET = 'insert your webhooks secret key'
```

16. Finally, go back to your `settings.py` file in Django and insert the following near the bottom of the file:

```
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
```

With these steps completed, you should be all set with caching, media files, and Stripe integration for your Django project.
